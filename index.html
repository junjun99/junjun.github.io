	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Arjun Mohammed</span> I'm a student at the University of Waterloo.</p>
	<p>I spent my first three semsters in the Computer Engineering Co-op program but after several work experiences, I have decided to switch into Statistics while pursuing a minor in CS to fuel my interest in data analytics and machine learning. I have worked at numerous start-ups at different stages, allowing me to make meaningful contributions and be exposed to a myriad of technologies in a fast paced environment. </p>

	<p> At my first co-op, I had the pleasure of working with <a href="https://interset.com/">Interset Cubersecurity and AI</a> and work on the installation and security of their insider threat platform. My next position was at <a href="https://www.hellogbye.ca/">HelloGbye</a> where I worked on increasing the efficiency and accuracy of automatic itenary generation from travel requests from email data. Finally, my current position is at <a href="https://www.loomanalytics.com/">Loom ANalytics</a> where I am exploring the application of state of the art NLP algorithms on Canadian legal cases to expedite the tedious process of data entry and discovery.</p>
	
	<p> Outside of work, I enjoy travelling, reading and spending time with my friends.</p>
