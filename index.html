	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Arjun Mohammed</span> and I'm an undergraduate student at the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/">University of Waterloo</a>.</p>
	<p>I spent my first three semsters in the Computer Engineering Co-op program and after several work experiences, I have decided to switch into Statistics while pursuing a minor in CS to fuel my interest in data analytics and machine learning. </p>

	<p>I have worked at numerous start-ups at different stages, allowing me to make meaningful contributions and be exposed to a myriad of technologies in a fast paced environment. </p>

	<p> At my first co-op, I had the pleasure of working at <a href="https://interset.com/">Interset Cybersecurity and AI</a> to enhance the installation and security of their insider threat platform. My next position was at <a href="https://www.hellogbye.com/">HelloGbye</a> where I worked on increasing the efficiency and accuracy of automatic itenary generation from travel requests in email data. My current position is at <a href="https://www.loomanalytics.com/">Loom Analytics</a> where I am exploring the application of state of the art NLP algorithms on Canadian legal cases to expedite the tedious process of data entry and discovery.</p>
	
	<p> My next co-op term will be during the Summer of 2020 and I am hoping to work at a large company to diversify and complement my current work experiences.</p>

	<p> Outside of work, I enjoy travelling, reading, spending time with my friends and "pun-ishing" them with great puns.</p>
